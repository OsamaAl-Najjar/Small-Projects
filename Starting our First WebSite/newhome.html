        <h1> Introduction to IT</h1>The terms "information technology" and "IT" are widely used in business and the field of computing.
        People use the terms generically when referring to various kinds of computerrelated work,
        which sometimes confuses their meaning.
        What Is Information Technology?
        A 1958 article in Harvard Business Review referred to information technology as consisting of three basic parts:
        computational data processing, decision support, and business software. This time period marked the beginning of IT as an officially defined area of business;
        in fact, this article probably coined the term.


        Over the ensuing decades, many corporations created socalled "IT departments" to manage the computer technologies related to their business.
        Whatever these departments worked on became the de facto definition of Information Technology, one that has evolved over time. Today,
        IT departments have responsibilities in areas like:<br>

        - Computer tech support<br>
        - Business computer network and database administration<br>
        - Business software deployment<br>
        - Information security<br>
        Especially during the dotcom boom of the 1990s, Information Technology also became associated with aspects of computing beyond those owned by IT departments.
        This broader definition of IT includes areas like:<br>

        - Software development<br>
        - Computer systems architecture<br>
        - Project management<br>

        <h1>The Essential Skills to Becoming a Master Hacker</h1>
        Many of my aspiring hackers have written to me asking the same thing. "What skills do I need to be a good hacker?"
        As the hacker is among the most skilled information technology disciplines, it requires a wide knowledge of IT technologies and techniques.
        To truly be a great hacker, one must master many skills. Don't be discouraged if you don't have all the skills I list here,
        but rather use this list as a starting ground for what you need to study and master in the near future.
        This is my overview list of required skills to enter the pantheon of this elite IT profession. I've broken the skills into three categories
        to help you go from one rung to the other more easily—fundamental, intermediate,
        and intangible skills—and have included links to related articles on Null Byte for you to get acquainted with.<br />
        <h2>The Fundamental Skills</h2>
        These are the basics that every hacker should know before even trying to hack.
        Once you have a good grasp on everything in this section, you can move into the intermediary level.

        <h1>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h1>
        Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
        Just as many humanbased languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
        The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.”
        Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
        These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.
        For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order,
        chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors. There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today.
        We’ve compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and indemand of these languages below.
