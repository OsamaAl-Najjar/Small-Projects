<div class="the_Content_p">What is the Internet?
The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks that connects university, government, commercial, and other computers in over 150 countries. There are thousands of networks, tens of thousands of computers, and millions of users on the Internet, with the numbers expanding daily. Using the Internet, you can send electronic mail, chat with colleagues around the world, and obtain information on a wide variety of subjects.

Three principal uses of the Internet are:

Electronic mail. Electronic mail, or e-mail, lets you electronically "mail" messages to users who have Internet E-mail addresses. Delivery time varies, but it's possible to send mail across the globe and get a response in minutes. LISTSERVs are special interest mailing lists which allow for the exchange of information between large numbers of people.
USENET newsgroups. USENET is a system of special interest discussion groups, called newsgroups, to which readers can send, or "post" messages which are then distributed to other computers in the network. (Think of it as a giant set of electronic bulletin boards.) Newsgroups are organized around specific topics, for example, alt.education.research, alt.education.distance, and misc.education.science.
Information files. Government agencies, schools, and universities, commercial firms, interest groups, and private individuals place a variety of information on-line. The files were originally text only, but increasingly contain pictures and sound.

<div class="the_Content_p"></br>How Do I Explore the Internet?
To access the Internet, you'll need a personal computer, a modem (or direct link to a network), telecommunications software, a telephone line, and an Internet account. Don't worry--this is easier than it sounds, but it still helps when you're getting started to have a few good books on the subject, or better yet, a friend who's an experienced "cyber surfer." Many universities provide Internet accounts to their faculty and students at little or no cost. Commercial vendors will provide Internet service for a fee. Make sure that you access your Internet provider with a local telephone call--otherwise, long distance charges will apply.

The easiest way for new users to navigate the Internet may be through the "gopher," a navigational system that uses a series of menus to organize and provide access to information. Unfortunately, "gopher," while easy to use, provides text-only information. It is much more rewarding to take full advantage of the multimedia opportunities available on the World-Wide Web (WWW). This system organizes information to provide for linkages to related documents (hypertext links), which allow users to move quickly and easily to related documents.

Software such as Mosaic and Netscape give users a graphical interface and (theoretically) allow for effortless "point and click" travel through cyberspace. If you want to use programs such as Mosaic and Netscape, you will need an up-to-date personal computer and a fast modem--the faster the better--but most users find the rewards worth the extra investment.</div>
